To access the GitHub repos, we have set up two Personal Access Tokens.

Student: hevyzksqs6c3s7igfwkahtkef46lsirrh7b5cvmbomxpe5ncauoq

Both tokens are set to expire in June.
If you have any issues with these tokens or need them revoked, ping Ian Reasor.

The GitHub repo is at https://git.cloudmanager.adobe.com/aem65lt/aem65lt.
When you try to clone this repo, it will ask for your username, which can be anything, and your PAT.
