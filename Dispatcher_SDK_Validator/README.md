The Dispatcher SDK provides:

* Dispatcher Configuration : a vanilla file structure containing the configuration files to include in a maven project for dispatcher
* Dispatcher Validator: tooling for customers to validate a dispatcher configuration locally
* Dispatcher Docker Image: a Docker image that brings up the dispatcher locally

The validation tool is available in the SDK as a macOS or Linux binary.

It allows customers to run the same validation that Cloud Manager will perform while building and deploying a release.
